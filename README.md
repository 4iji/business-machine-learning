# Business Machine Learning and Data Science 

***Caution:*** This is a work in progress, core development to be done by July 2019. 

A curated list of business machine learning (BML) and business data science (BDS) frameworks, libraries, software and research. The code in this repository is in Python unless otherwise stated. The catalogue is inspired by `awesome-machine-learning`.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me [@dereknow](https://twitter.com/dereknow).
Also, a listed repository should be deprecated if:

* Repository's owner explicitly say that "this library is not maintained".
* Not committed for long time (2~3 years).
